##Here are our instructional videos: 

###Software Installation:

Knickers (creates cmaps): http://www.bnxinstall.com/knickers/Knickers.htm

Label Density Calculator (to check the label density of a specific genome): http://bnxinstall.com/labeldensitycalculator/LabelDensityCalculator.htm

###Training videos: 

Training video #1 covers calculating label density for a fasta file. We report our recommendation to the wet bench. The goal is to have a label density between 10 and 13. We generally only use BspQI, BbvCI or both.

Training video #2 covers how to make an in silico cmap to use as the reference during assembly.
